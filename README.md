# Optimale Synonyme Codons

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. to use Cuda for NVIDIA GPU acceleration, install pytorch with the following command first
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    ```
5. Install all other requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
